# Speech-Based-Person-Recognition-for-Biometric-Applications
Using a one dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) trained on speech signalsâ€™ Fourier Magnitude spectra, the uniqueness of speech based on frequency response is studied. The paper demonstrates 3 different models being trained and the results are compared.
